# REPO NAME: MRCS-BB-Wemos

DThis board contains a Wemos D1 processor, 1A regulator, level shifters and an MCP23017 to provide a rougth equivalent to a BB-Leo.
This board has considerably more code space and will eventually support a "local fall back" mode when no CMRINet is present and may
support other protocols over WiFi.  It will use John Plochers forthcoming cpNode sketch.
