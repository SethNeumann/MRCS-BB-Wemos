This board contains a Wemos D1 processor, 1A regulator, level shifters and an MCP23017 to provide a rougth equivalent to a BB-Leo.

The Wemos D1 has considerably more code space than a ProMini/Leonardo
and could eventually support a "local fall back" mode when no CMRINet
is present and may support other protocols over WiFi.  It will use
John Plochers forthcoming cpNode sketch.
